# Narrative
CommBank's Goal Tracker solution has performed well on mobile. Now the Goal Tracker ("GT") team is currently building out a minimum viable product on the web. The GT Product Owner, Amanda, wants users to be able to set an icon for each goal. And on the GT team, every intern gets a clearly scoped out onboarding assignment to own from end to end.

Enabling icons on goals is your project! Although you are the Directly Responsible Individual ("DRI"), we appreciate it's only week one of your internship. Tagg, our Tech Lead, scoped out the work for you and organized the individual tasks in a way that will help you get ramped up. Take this on with an ownership mentality! But also remember this is a safe and controlled environment created to help you onboard effectively.

# Epic
## Backend
**Video instructions**
Hey it's Tagg, Tech Lead of the Goal Tracker team. To enable icons we need to extend our backend. But first we need to get you up and running with rSERVER! I've scoped down the task for you. You'll start by onboarding to MongoDB and seeding your development instance. You will modify the Goal model using C# and .NET and conduct some manual testing using Postman. This is a safe and controlled environment we've created to help you get ramped up. Go step by step. Take your time. Check out the linked docs if you get stuck

**Background**
To support icons we need to extend our existing .NET backend written in C#. This series of tasks will onboard you to rSERVER.

**Scope**
- [ ] Get started with rSERVER
- [ ] Modify the Goal model to have a public optional `Icon` field of `string` type

## Frontend
**Video instructions**
Hey again it's Tagg, Tech Lead of the Goal Tracker team. To enable icons we need to build out our frontend. But first we need to get you up and running with rWEB! I've scoped down the task for you. You'll start by cloning the repo and installing its dependencies. You will modify the Goal model using TypeScript. Then you will integrate an emoji picker and extend the existing React components and Redux store to enable users to add and change icons. Remember this is a safe and controlled environment we've created to help you get ramped up! Go step by step. Take your time. Check out the linked docs if you get stuck.

## Backend + Frontend
**Video instructions**
Hey again it's Tagg, Tech Lead of the Goal Tracker team. We've done the server and client work needed to support icons. But on client refresh, icon changes don't persist. We need to wire together the backend and frontend! I've scoped down the task for you. You'll start by writing a PUT request. Then you will modify the on click event handler that fires after picking an icon. Remember this is a safe environment we've created to help you get ramped up! Go step by step. Take your time. Check out the linked docs if you get stuck.

**Background**
To support icons we need to wire together our backend and frontend changes. This series of tasks will onboard you to our networking patterns.

## Testing
**Video instructions**
Hey again it's Tagg, Tech Lead of the Goal Tracker team. Icons are supported! Awesome job. Next you need to write unit tests. I've scoped down the task for you. You will use the xUnit testing framework to cover your changes. Don't forget this is a safe environment we've created to help you get ramped up! Go step by step. Take your time. Check out the linked docs if you get stuck.

**Background**
Icons are supported in code! But before you can land your changes, you need to cover them. This series of tasks will onboard you to our testing patterns.

## Git
**Video instructions**
Hey again it's Tagg, Tech Lead of the Goal Tracker team. You've extended the backend and frontend, wired them together, and implemented tests to verify their behavior. But you're changes live in your local environment only! I've scoped down the task for you. You'll need to commit your changes to a new branch and then push that commit to the remote repository so myself and other engineers on the team can review. Remember this is a safe environment we've created to help you get ramped up! Go step by step. Take your time. Check out the linked docs if you get stuck.

**Background**
Go ahead and put up a pull request! Excellent job!
